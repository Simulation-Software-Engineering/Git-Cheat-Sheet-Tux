# Git Workflow

This section is based on [this](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/version-control/material/workflow_slides.md) lecture.
The different workflows are summarized in the following sections.

## Feature Branch Workflow

- only working code on main
- feature branches
- merge feature branches into main with pull request
- good for: small teams

## Gitflow

- main and develop branches
- feature branches branched from develop
- good for: larger teams

## Forking Workflow

- larger (open-source) projects with many users
- access rights more controlled by maintainers
